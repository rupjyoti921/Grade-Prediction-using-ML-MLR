# Grade Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict students' final grades based on their internal exam marks. It uses **multiple linear regression** and **logistic regression** models to forecast grades, leveraging powerful Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. The project is designed to assist educators and institutions in assessing students' performance early on.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict final grades of students using internal exam scores.
- **Techniques**: Multiple Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.
- **Libraries Used**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
- **Data**: A dataset consisting of students' internal exam marks and corresponding final grades.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, feature selection, and data normalization.
- **Model Building**: Created and trained models using both linear and logistic regression techniques.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and mean squared error (MSE).
- **Visualization**: Visualized data distribution and regression line using Matplotlib.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data trends and model performance.
  - **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
